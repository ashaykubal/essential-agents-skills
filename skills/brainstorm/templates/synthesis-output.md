# {Topic} — Brainstorm Synthesis

## Consensus Areas

{Where all roles agree — foundation for implementation}

| Area | Supporting Roles | Confidence |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| {area} | SME, PM, Architect, Dev Lead, Critic | HIGH |

## Divergence Areas

{Where roles disagree — requires decision}

### {Divergence 1}

- **{Role A}**: {position}
- **{Role B}**: {position}
- **Decision needed**: {what must be decided}

## Critical Analyst Verdict

**Verdict**: {proceed / modify / defer / kill}
**Confidence**: {high / medium / low}
**Conditions**: {conditions for verdict to hold}

## Implementation Outline

{High-level approach combining Architect's design, Dev Lead's plan, PM's priorities}

### v1 Scope (from PM)

{What is in v1, what is deferred}

### Architecture (from Architect)

{How it fits together}

### Build Plan (from Dev Lead)

{Ordering, dependencies, effort}

## Risks and Mitigations

{Consolidated from all roles, prioritized by Critical Analyst}

| Risk | Source Role | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|
| {risk} | Dev Lead | HIGH | {mitigation} |

## Open Questions
