# {Topic} — Research Synthesis

## Key Findings (Convergent)

{Findings where multiple viewpoints agree — these are high confidence}

| Finding | Supporting Viewpoints | Confidence |
|---------|----------------------|------------|
| {finding} | Direct Investigation, Practitioner | HIGH |
| {finding} | Contrarian, First Principles | HIGH |

## Tensions and Trade-offs

{Where viewpoints disagree — present both sides, flag for decision}

### {Tension 1}

- **View A** ({viewpoint}): {position}
- **View B** ({viewpoint}): {position}
- **Implication**: {what this means for decision-making}

## Unique Insights

{Findings from a single viewpoint that add important nuance}

| Insight | Source Viewpoint | Confidence |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| {insight} | Contrarian | MEDIUM |

## Confidence Map

| Finding | Supporting Viewpoints | Confidence |
|---------|----------------------|------------|
| ... | Viewpoints 1, 3, 5 | HIGH |
| ... | Viewpoint 2 only | MEDIUM |
| ... | Inference only | LOW |
