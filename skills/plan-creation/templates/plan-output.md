{2-3 paragraphs: goal, approach, key risks. Written in prose for human readability. This section is NOT parsed by tooling — it exists for stakeholders.}

CLEAR COMPATIBILITY NOTES (for adapter layer):

Field mapping to CLEAR's MasterPlan interface (plan/types.ts):
  version        → MasterPlan.version          (direct)
  project_name   → MasterPlan.projectName      (snake_case → camelCase)
  status         → MasterPlan.status            (direct)
  phases[].id    → Phase.id                     (direct)
  phases[].name  → Phase.name                   (direct)
  phases[].status → Phase.status                (direct, PhaseStatus enum)
  phases[].workpackages → Phase.workpackages    (TRANSFORM: object[] → string[] of WP IDs)
  phases[].weights → Phase.weights              (direct, Record<string, number>)
  phases[].dependencies → Phase.dependencies    (direct, string[])
  milestones[].id → Milestone.id                (direct)
  milestones[].name → Milestone.name            (direct)
  milestones[].phase → Milestone.phase          (direct)
  milestones[].type → Milestone.type            (direct, MilestoneType enum)
  milestones[].requires → Milestone.requires    (direct, string[])
  milestones[].status → Milestone.status        (direct, MilestoneStatus enum)

Fields NOT present at plan creation (populated by CLEAR at runtime):
  MasterPlan.activePhase      → set when first phase starts
  MasterPlan.activeWorkpackage → set when first WP starts
  Phase.systemId              → generated by CLEAR's dual-ID system
  Phase.position              → inferred from array order
  Phase.detailFile            → optional, created by CLEAR

Primary transform needed: phases[].workpackages from inline objects to string[] IDs.
CLEAR's parseMasterPlanContent() would extract WP IDs and store details separately.
